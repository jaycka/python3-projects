11. Flash-card: A flash card program written in python3 using `tkinter` module. It will read from local `words_to_learn.csv` file that contains all the words you left from previous study, if no such file, it will read default `french_words.csv` and get your study started. The program will display french word first for 3 seconds, after it will turn back, you can press check or cross button to let the program know if you knew this word already or not, the program will remember.
